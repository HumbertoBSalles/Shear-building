# Modal Analysis of a Multi-Story Shear Building

## ðŸ“˜ Description

This Jupyter Notebook performs the **modal analysis** of a multi-story shear building for academic purposes. It defines the **stiffness**, **mass**, and **damping matrices**, computes the **natural frequencies**, **mode shapes**, and **effective modal masses**, and visualizes the **mode shapes** using Python.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This project is intended **strictly for academic and educational use**. It was developed to support learning and teaching in structural dynamics and earthquake engineering. The code is not optimized for production or commercial applications.

## ðŸ“Š Features

- Construction of stiffness, mass, and damping matrices  
- Computation of natural frequencies and mode shapes  
- Calculation of effective modal masses  
- Visualization of mode shapes

## ðŸ§  Requirements

The notebook depends on the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `matplotlib`

Install them with:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
